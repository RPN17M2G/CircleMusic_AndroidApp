# CircleMusic_AndroidApp

An Android operating system application that was created for a final project in 10 points computer engineering.

MP3 File Player Application.
The application uploads MP3 music files and M3U playlist files from the device's memory while filtering call recordings. 
A cloud-based database is utilized to back up the user's songs and playlists and synchronize them across different devices.
Once synchronized, the songs can be played without requiring internet access. 
The application enables control over the playing music, playlist creation and management.
Additionally, there are security measures in place to protect user privacy, including the use of advanced SHA256 hashing function for the one-way encryption of data in the database.
The interface is designed to be reactive and dynamic, with background colors changing according to the image of the playing song or the selected playlist.

The full project description(In Hebrew) will be uploaded at the 9th of June 2023.
*This repository lacks issues and commits because of private information is included until removal at the 9th of June 2023.
