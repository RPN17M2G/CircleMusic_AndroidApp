# CircleMusic_AndroidApp

An Android operating system application that was created for a final project in 10 points computer engineering at school.

MP3 Player Application.
The application retrieves MP3 music files and M3U playlist files from the device's storage while filtering call recordings. 
A cloud-based database is utilized to back up the user's songs and playlists and synchronize them across different devices.
Once synchronized, the songs can be played without requiring internet access. 
The application enables control over the playing music, playlist creation and management.
Additionally, there are security measures in place to protect user privacy, including the use of advanced SHA256 hashing function for one-way encryption of users's emails in the database.
The interface is designed to be reactive and dynamic, with background colors changing according to the dominant color of the image of the playing song or the selected playlist.
